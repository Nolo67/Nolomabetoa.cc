          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I’m a data analyst and machine learning enthusiast currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at Hult International Business School. My work bridges technical analysis and real-world problem solving, with a focus on uncovering insight, simplifying complexity, and supporting better decision-making. I have hands-on experience working with Python, SQL, and data visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau. Whether I’m cleaning data, building models, or presenting findings, I focus on clarity, context, and impact. I enjoy exploring the full data journey, from raw input to meaningful insight—and I’m particularly drawn to projects that require thoughtful storytelling, collaborative thinking, and technical precision.</p>

<p>My portfolio includes projects in marketing performance, operations analysis, and text-based automation, as well as exploratory work in machine learning and dynamic content generation. I’ve collaborated on model development, built interactive dashboards, and designed logic-driven applications using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. I also bring experience in cross-functional teamwork, project coordination, and stakeholder communication. I’m comfortable leading initiatives, but I value environments where learning and shared ownership are encouraged. Above all, I believe that good data work is about asking better questions, making ideas visible, and creating value through insight. This portfolio reflects some of what I’ve done and what I’m eager to keep exploring.</p>
